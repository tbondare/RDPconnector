I want to control PC of my mom and to help her in case of troubles. So I decided to use RDP protocol for this. But mine PC and
PC of my mom connected to different local networks. And I can't connect directly to mom's PC.
So I decided to write a program to connect mom's PC and mine through my public server.

This program is for connecting one computer with another and should be used with any RDP client and server.

The program must be run on public server with flag s. And the program must be run on computer with RDP server with flag c.

format input string for server: <name program> s <front port (for rdp client)> <back port (for rdp server)>
(example: RDPconector s 60000 60001)
format input string for client: <name program> c <front port (for rdp client)> <front host (for rdp client)>
                                                   <back port (for rdp server)> <back host (for rdp server)>
(example: RDPconector c 60001 127.0.0.1 60002 127.0.0.1)
